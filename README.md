# sportsstore
 I will create a new project to develop on Angular. The application, which is called SportsStore, will use the classic approach, implemented in online stores around the world. I will create an electronic catalog of products that customers can browse by category and by page; a basket in which users can add or delete products; and an ordering process in which customers can enter data for delivery and place orders.
